# 0x07. Python - Test-driven development

## An Overview
This directory was created to do tasks that are meant to improve my understanding
of test driven development in python.<br>
Some of the ways to write tests in python is by using doctest module or using the
unittest module. The doctest module is used when test for a program are written
in the program's documentation. Doctests is helpful for checking the validity of
the documentation, especially examples found in the docs. Unittests are more
powerful compared to doctest, it has several in-built features that are uniavailable
doctest. Since unittest follows the object oriented method, it is more suitable
for testing class-based methods in non-production environment.
